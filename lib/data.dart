      'A huge, magical eel in Melanesian mythology. According to Melanesian mythology the Abaia is a type of large eel which dwells at the bottom of freshwater lakes in the Fiji, Solomon and Vanuatu Islands. The Abaia is said to consider all creatures in the lake its children and protects them furiously against anyone who would harm or disturb them. It is said that those who are foolish enough to try to catch the fish from a lake containing the Abaia are immediately overwhelmed by a large wave caused by the thrashing of the Abaia\'s powerful tail. Another version of the legend states that if someone were to harm a creature living in the Abaia\'s home, the Abaia would cause a great rain storm flooding the land and drowning those who had caused the harm. One example of this ability is illustrated in the following story: One day a man discovered a lake in which were many fish, and at the bottom of the lake lived a magic eel, but the man knew it not. He caught many fish and returned the next day with the people of his village whom he had told of his discovery, and they also were very successful, while one woman even laid hold of the great eel, Abaia, who dwelt in the depths of the lake, though he escaped her. Now Abaia was angry that his fish had been caught and that he himself had been seized, so he caused a great rain to fall that night, and the waters of the lake also rose, and all the people were drowned except an old woman who had not eaten of the fish and who saved herself in a tree. Although it would seem that the magical powers of the Abaia are the byproduct of human imagination and its fear of the unknown,  it has been suggested that the Abaia legend may have stemmed from encounters with an actual undiscovered species of giant eel living at the bottom of these remote lakes.',

      'An Abath is a legendary creature resembling a unicorn, first appearing in records in the 16th century. Accounts of the Abath were brought back by 16th-century European travellers to the Malay Peninsula. Described as female, with a single horn growing from its forehead, it is speculated that these were probably the result of a half-glimpsed Javan or Sumatran rhinoceros. Like the unicorn, a powder made from this horn supposedly served both as an aphrodisiac and as an antidote to poison. However, since the unicorn was invariably represented as male, and since there was only ever one in existence at any time, the Abath seems to have developed independently from the European myths of the one-horned creature.',

  'text':
      'The Abatwa are extremely small men; they "go under the grass, and sleep in anthills." They travel in the mist and live in the upcountry in the rocks; and they have no village. They are wholly nomadic, and kill large animals with poisoned arrows; and when they\'ve killed an animal, they eat every piece of it leaving nothing behind. If an area has no more animals to hunt, the Abatwa gather together and ride on a horse\'s back single-file from neck to tail to go look for better hunting grounds... and if they don\'t find something, they eat the horse. The Abatwa represent a great danger to the Zulu (people who are an Nguni ethnic group in Southern Africa)because they are armed with poisoned arrows which caused uncontrollable bleeding... which is why an Umutwa (the proper name for a single Abatwa) can hunt and kill large animals, but also makes a single Abatwa arrow deadly to a full sized Zulu. So Zulu had to be careful in how they treated any Abatwa they might encounter, and there was one major point the Zuuhad to keep in mind: Abatwa hated being told or reminded they were tiny. Any indication from a Zulu that they felt an Umutwa was small would instantly result in the Zulu being shot and killed! For this reason, the Zulu have adapted the rather unusual greeting of "I saw you!" when encountering any Abatwa. If the tiny warrior then asks the Zulu where he saw them from, the Zulu needs to answer in a way that implies a great size to the minuscule threat, such as "I saw you from that mountain over there." Such a greeting only works, however, if the Umutwa is somehow seen or detected; the true dreadfulness of the Abatwa comes from the very fact that their size makes them almost invisible in most circumstances. An Umutwa could shoot and kill a Zulu who nearly stepped on him without the Zulu ever seeing the being that has killed them... an attacking animal or a murderous man could be faced and dealt with, but the possibility of being killed in a way that cannot be reacted to, that ignores your personal strengths and capabilities, is truly dreadful. This worry prevents sleep and est, for the only comfort is too avoid the territory of the Abatwa altogether.',

      'The Adlet (or Erqigdlet) are a race of creatures in the Inuit mythology of Greenland, as well as the Labrador and Hudson Bay coasts. While the word refers to inland native American tribes, it also denotes a humanoid dog-legged tribe. The lower part of the body of the canine Adlet is like that of a dog and their upper part is like a man\'s. All Adlet run quickly, and their encounters with men usually end with man as the victor. In Inuit lore, they are often portrayed as in conflict with humans, and are supposed to be taller than Inuit and white people. In some stories they are cannibals. Inuit from Labrador use the term Adlet, tribes west of the Hudson Bay use the word Erqigdlit. The monstrous race begotten by the Adlet was identified with inland native Americans by the Labrador and Hudson Bay tribes; Inuit from Greenland and Baffin Land, which had no native American neighbors, use the term to refer to the half human, half canine creatures. An etymology of the word is proposed by H. Newell Wardle: adlet might come from ad, "below," and thus denote "those below." Alternatively, he argues, it might come from the stem agdlak, "striped, streaked," thus "the striped ones," in reference to American Indians who lived to the west and painted their faces. "Erqigdlet" might be a derogatory term denoting the same people. Atlat means "others," denoting American Indians from the Inuit perspective, though Newell Wardle considers this possibility secondary and deriving from phonetic similarity.',

      'The Afanc was a monstrous creature that, like most lake monsters, was said to prey upon any foolish enough to fall into or swim in its lake. One of the earliest descriptions of it is given by the 15th century poet Lewys Glyn Cothi, who described it as living in Llyn Syfaddon or Llangorse Lake, now in Powys. One tale relates that it was rendered helpless by a maiden who let it sleep upon her lap; while it slept, the maiden\'s fellow villagers bound the creature in chains. The creature was awakened and made furious; its enraged thrashings crushed the maiden, in whose lap it still lay. It was finally dragged away to the lake Cwm Ffynnon, or killed by Peredur. In the tale, Peredur son of Efrawg, resides in a cave near the \'Palace of the Sons of the King of the Tortures\'. The Palace is so named as the Addanc slays the three sons (chieftains) of the king each day, only for them to be resurrected by the maidens of the court. It is not stated why this cycle of violence continues, but when Peredur asks to ride with the three chieftains, who seek out the Addanc daily, they state that they will not accept his company as if he was slain they would not be able to bring him back to life. Peredur continues to the cave on his own, wishing to kill the creature to increase his fame and honour. On his journey, he meets a maiden who states that the Addanc will slay Peredur through cunning, as the beast is invisible and kills his victims with poison darts. The maiden, actually the Queen of Constantinople, gives Peredur a seeing stone, which will make the creature visible. Peredur ventures into the cave and with the aid of the stone, pierces the Addanc before beheading it. When the three chieftains arrive at the cave they state that it was predicted that Peredur would kill the Addanc. Some legends ascribe the creature\'s death to King Arthur. Close to Llyn Barfog in Snowdonia is a hoof-print petrosomatoglyph etched deep into the rock "Carn March Arthur", or the "Stone of Arthur\'s Horse", which was supposedly made by King Arthur\'s mount, Llamrai, when it was hauling the Afanc from the lake.',

Little is known of this spirit, other than that it shapeshifts from an orca to a wolf when hungry.

The only thing they could think of was the wolf tracks coming out of the water. The Akhlut is very vicious, and even attacks you if you have fallen asleep near the edge. Sometimes it goes as far as the Inuit camp to snatch them up. It has a furious appetite and would eat anything that\'s close by. There are many stories of how the Akhlut came to be but, this legend is the most popular: It’s about a man who is obsessed with the sea and wants to be with it all the time. After coming off the shore, he returns to his village, but his people don’t recognize him; because he has become too obsessed with the ocean and he gets banned from the village. While out on his own, he finds pack of wolves, and because he is so hungry, like a wolf, for revenge; he becomes one with them. One day, his affection for the ocean becomes so insane that he jumps into the ocean, to be with it. He then, transforms into an orca.

According to Shinto mythology, the creature is human-like and contains a bright red color. The 19th century account by John Batchelor confirms this. His book, The Ainu and Their Folklore, provides many details of the creature. It states that the creature was 120 meters in length. The book specifies that the red color of the Akkorokamui a striking red, seemingly “likened to the color of the reflection of the setting sun upon water”. The Akkorokamui is also characteristically described with the ability to self-amputate, like several octopus species, and regenerate limbs. This characteristic manifests in the belief in Shinto that Akkorokamui has healing powers. Consequently, it is believed among followers that giving offerings to Akkorokamui will heal ailments of the body, in particular, disfigurements and broken limbs. Nade yakushi is housed within the Takoyakushi-do, a shrine dedicated to Nade yakushi, along the street Teramachi-dori, meaning “Temple town,” in Kyoto. Once, spirits cursed Rebunge, a villager of Abuta Toyoura, to see the destruction of his town. They sent a part-spider-part-human creature, Yaoshikepu, to fulfill the curse. Yaoshikepu caused rampant destruction throughout the town, slaughtering so many that the streets were filled with crimson blood. After hearing the townsfolk tremble with fear, the sea kami, Repunkamui, transformed Yaoshikepu into an octopus, and cast her into the sea. After Yaoshikepu was cast into the sea, her size began to grow, eventually beginning to consume larger prey, such as whales and ships. One day, Akkorokamui gobbled up a boat full of fishermen. In her stomach, they called for help. Hearing the cries, Repunkamui poisoned Akkorokamui, giving her great pain. As Akkorokamui hollered in agony, the fishermen escaped. However, Akkorokamui learned to harness the venom, using it to attack her prey. In a 1800s sighting, John Batchelor stated that as the monster attacked the ship, it “emitted a dark fluid which has a very powerful and noxious odour”, confirming the myth\’s actuality.',

While typically benevolent and helpful, alan are also known to be vengeful. They care very deeply for their children. Alan appear mostly human, but they sport a pair of wings that allow them to fly. As they age their skin begins to wrinkle, and in one instance an old alan was described with skin as thick as a carabao hide. They have long fingers and toes with long, sharp nails. Their hands and feet are backwards, with their fingers fastened at the wrist and their toes fastened at the heel. When they walk, their toes spread and they bend over double. These beings are usually found living in golden or otherwise fine houses, full of riches such as pots and jars filled with beads and gold. They often live deep in the woods near springs, and they can be found hanging upside down from trees. In general, they are friendly, helpful, and celebratory. They often perform tasks for humans or provide them with useful information. When idle, they are often found dancing for long periods of time. Alan gather menstrual blood, miscarried fetuses, and reproductive waste using headaxes, often from water after a woman has gone to wash her hair. They place the blood in a dish that they have inherited from previous generations, then cover it. Soon after, a human child forms from the blood, and they then clothe the child and give them a name. Humans created by alan have supernatural abilities, and are sometimes described winning battles with formidable opponents even as children. They will also often defeat evil spirits that have been troubling towns. Folk heroes often introduce themselves as the child of an alan in order to imply that they are more powerful than an average human. Their reason for creating and adopting human children like this is usually because they have no children of their own, and so have no one to inherit their possessions.

They will also give the family the golden house that they live in, which usually appears in the family\'s town the next day. The alan then flies away, and is usually not heard from again.',

      'The Almas is an ape-like cryptid reported from Central Asia. They are said to inhabit the Asian mountain regions of Pamir and Caucasus as well as the Mongolian mountain range Altai. Sightings of the Almas date back as early as the 15th century. This creature has been sighted walking upright just like a human. In fact, it looks more human than a bigfoot-type creature, even said to craft clothes and tools. It is said to resemble a living cave-man. Their bodies are covered entirely with thick brown to reddish-brown hair. The facial region remains uncovered, but patches of skin are dark. The skull structure of the almasty possesses a protruding brow ridge, slanting forehead, flat nose, and large protruding jaw. Their feet are large and their fingers are long, their appendages are completely covered with hair, except for their hands. Almas is a Mongolian word for "wild man". The plural term almasty is derived from Russian, while other variations of the name are Almasti, Almaslar, Bnahua, and Ochokochi, which translates as the name for a forest deity in the West Asian regions, such as Azerbaijan and Georgia. Current accounts of the most recent sightings of the almas locate it near the southern part of Mongolia, along the Altai Mountains and the Tien Shan pass near the northern border of China. First accounted in historical records in the 1400\'s, Almas is not used to refer to one organism, but a community of many. These individuals are described as subspecies of hominids, in which humans and primates like orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees belong to. Almasti resemble the appearance and body framework of Neanderthals, another species of hominid, which roamed western Asia, far north Africa, and Europe, and became extinct about 30,000 years ago. Almasti are bipedal organisms, which can walk upright on two hind legs. The common height range for almas is five feet tall, but adults can be as high as six to six and a half feet. Their bodies are covered entirely with thick brown to reddish-brown hair. The facial region remains uncovered, but patches of skin are dark. The skull structure of the almas possesses a protruding brow ridge, slanting forehead, flat nose, and large protruding jaw. Their feet are large and their fingers are long, their appendages are completely covered with hair, except for their hands. In the 1800s, a man claimed to have domesticated a female Almas named Zana. The creature, after being held within numerous enclosures for many years, was trained to carry out daily tasks such as grinding grain for flour and hauling firewood. Zana, however, never learned to speak, instead using grunts and mutterings. The Almas was very athletic, fond of swimming and apparently had a taste for wine. Zana later mated with a local man and had four children. A tooth sample of one of the children was tested, so they could be real. Accounts from Russian historian Professor Boris Porchnev in 1964 explained that the Almas appeared to have a cone-shaped skull, and the teeth structures are similar to humans, except that the canines are wider. Porchnev has even reported to have encountered the descendants of the Almas, which were grouped in families that dwelled in holes on the ground. Porchnev further describes the human-like beings as having excellent swimming and running abilities, a foul odor, and a diet that consists of small mammals, vegetables, and fruits. The almasty, as nomadic creatures, have traveled beyond the areas of Mongolia in which they were frequently sighted by farmers and villagers. Stories and reports dating from the last fifty years have located the almas community around the Caucasus mountains near Russia and the Black Sea. Artifacts and evidences of the existence of almas communities have also been found in the Pamir mountains of Central Asia. One of the most recent expeditions that aimed to locate the almas was led by Russian cryptozoologist Dr. Marie-Jeanne Kofman and Frenchman Sylvain Pallix in 1992.

They are not particularly cute, and have pudgy, upturned noses. Despite their childish appearance, amefuri kozō are charged with the very important task of causing rainfall. Wherever they go, they cause clouds to form and rain to come down. In ancient China, amefuri kozō were thought to be the servants of the god of rainfall, who is known as Ushi in Japanese. Amefuri kozō are shy and rarely interact directly with people. However, they enjoy stealing people’s umbrellas and wearing them as hats. They then cause rain showers to fall upon their victims. Amefuri kozō became widely known thanks to the printing boom during the Edo period. They were common characters in the cheap, pocket-sized publications sold by street vendors known as kibyōshi, or yellow covers. Kibyōshi were satirical comics, heavy on illustrations, depicting urban life with easy-to-read prose. Amefuri kozō and other priest boy yōkai became popular in these adult-oriented comic books. People enjoyed their grotesque, silly, yet somewhat cute appearance. Rain that falls while the sun is out is known in Japan as kitsune no yomeiri—fox weddings. Kitsune (fox yōkai) hold their weddings during sun showers. Before getting married, kitsune will say a prayer to the amefuri kozō for rain on their wedding day.',

A funerary deity, her titles included "Devourer of the Dead", "Eater of Hearts", and "Great of Death". Ammit lived near the scales of justice in Duat, the Egyptian underworld. In the Hall of Two Truths, Anubis weighed the heart of a person against the feather of Ma\'at, the goddess of truth, which was depicted as an ostrich feather (the feather was often pictured in Ma\'at\'s headdress). If the heart was judged to be not pure, Ammit would devour it, and the person undergoing judgment was not allowed to continue their voyage towards Osiris and immortality. Once Ammit swallowed the heart, the soul was believed to become restless forever; this was called "to die a second time". Ammit was also sometimes said to stand by a lake of fire. In some traditions, the unworthy hearts were cast into the fiery lake to be destroyed. Some scholars believe Ammit and the lake represent the same concept of destruction. Ammit was not worshipped; instead, she embodied all that the Egyptians feared, threatening to bind them to eternal restlessness if they did not follow the principle of Ma\'at.',

      'Amphisbaena, a Greek word, from amphis, meaning "both ways", and bainein, meaning "to go", also called the Mother of Ants, is a mythological, ant-eating serpent with a head at each end. According to Greek mythology, the amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from the Gorgon Medusa\'s head as Perseus flew over the Libyan Desert with it in his hand. Cato\'s army then encountered it along with other serpents on the march. Amphisbaenae fed off of the corpses left behind. The amphisbaena has been referred to by the poets and the amphisbaena as a mythological and legendary creature. This early description of the amphisbaena depicts a venomous, dual-headed snakelike creature. However, Medieval and later drawings often show it with two or more scaled feet, particularly chicken feet and feathered wings. Some even depict it as a horned, dragon-like creature with a serpent-headed tail and small, round ears, while others have both "necks" of equal size so that it cannot be determined which is the rear head. Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet Nicander seems to contradict this by describing it as "always dull of eye". He also says: "From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other." Nicander\'s account seems to be referring to what is indeed called the Amphisbaenia. In ancient times, the supposedly dangerous amphisbaena had many uses in the art of folk medicine and other such remedies. It is said that expecting women wearing a live amphisbaena around their necks would have safe pregnancies, however if your goal is to cure ailments such as arthritis or the common cold wear only its skin. By eating the meat of the amphisbaena one could attract many lovers of the opposite sex, and slaying one during the full moon could give power to one who is pure of heart and mind. Lumberjacks suffering from cold weather on the job could nail its carcass or skin to a tree to keep warm, while in the process allowing the tree to fall easier.',

      'Anansi, the spider, is one of the most popular animal tricksters from West African mythology. Tricksters are mischievous figures who often oppose the will of the gods, resulting in some kind of misfortune for humans. Like many trickster figures, the wily Anansi can change his appearance to look like a human, a rabbit, a fox, or other animals. West Africans originally considered Anansi to be the creator of the world. He often acted as a go-between for humans in their dealings with the sky god Nyame, and he supposedly persuaded Nyame to give both rain and the night to people. In most stories, however, Anansi is a crafty and cunning trickster who makes life more enjoyable for himself (or more difficult for others) by fooling humans, other animals, and even the gods themselves, often using his cleverness and knowledge of his victims\' ways of thinking to trick them and achieve his purpose. In one well-known tale, Anansi asks God for an ear of corn and promises to repay with 100 servants. He takes the corn to a village and tells the people that it is sacred. During the night, Anansi feeds the corn to chickens. The next morning, he accuses the villagers of stealing the corn, and they give him a bushel of it to make up for the lost ear. Anansi next meets a man on the road and exchanges the corn for a chicken. He visits another village and tells the people that the chicken is sacred. That night he kills the chicken, and the next morning the frightened villagers give him ten sheep to replace it. Anansi later exchanges the sheep for a corpse, which he takes to a third village and tells the people that it is the sleeping son of God. When the villagers cannot wake the corpse the next morning, Anansi says they have killed God\'s son. The terrified villagers offer him 100 of their finest young men, and Anansi takes them to God to fulfill his part of the bargain. In some parts of North America, Anansi became known as Aunt Nancy or Miss Nancy in African American folklore.',

Archeologists have identified Anubis\'s sacred animal as an Egyptian canid, the African golden wolf. The African wolf was formerly called the "African golden jackal", until a 2015 genetic analysis updated the taxonomy and the common name for the species. As a result, Anubis is often referred to as having a "jackal" head, but this "jackal" is now more properly called a "wolf". Like many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts. Depicted as a protector of graves as early as the First Dynasty (c. 3100 – c. 2890 BC), Anubis was also an embalmer. By the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) he was replaced by Osiris in his role as lord of the underworld. One of his prominent roles was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife. He attended the weighing scale during the "Weighing of the Heart", in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead. Despite being one of the most ancient and "one of the most frequently depicted and mentioned gods" in the Egyptian pantheon, Anubis played almost no role in Egyptian myths. Anubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized regeneration, life, the soil of the Nile River, and the discoloration of the corpse after embalming. Anubis is associated with his brother Wepwawet, another Egyptian god portrayed with a dog\'s head or in canine form, but with grey or white fur. Historians assume that the two figures were eventually combined. Anubis\' female counterpart is Anput. His daughter is the serpent goddess Kebechet.',

Bakekujira are animated whale skeletons which sail near the surface of the sea, rising as they did in life when they would have had to breathe. They are followed by a host of eerie birds and strange fish. They appear on rainy nights near coastal whaling villages. In the old days, when whales were still plentiful in the Sea of Japan, a whale sighting was a blessing for the residents of a poor fishing village. A village could reap huge amounts of wealth from the meat and oil in a single whale. Such a bounty did not come without a price, however, and many fishermen claim that the souls of these whales live on as bakekujira, seeking revenge against the humans who took their lives. Those who witness a bakekujira are infected with its horrible curse, which they bring back to their villages when they return home. The whale’s curse brings famine, plague, fires, and other kinds of disasters to the villages it hits. One rainy night long ago, some fishers living on the Shimane peninsula witnessed an enormous white shape off the coast in the Sea of Japan. Squinting their eyes, it appeared to them to be a whale swimming offshore. Excited for the catch, they rallied the townspeople, who grabbed their spears and harpoons and took to their boats to hunt down and catch their quarry. They soon reached the whale, but no matter how many times they hurled their weapons, not one of them struck true. When they looked closer, through the dark, rain-spattered water’s surface, they realized why: what they thought was a white whale was actually a humongous skeleton swimming in the sea, not a single bit of flesh on its entire body. At that very moment, the sea became alive with a host strange fish that nobody had ever seen before, and the sky swarmed full of eerie birds which nobody could recognize and the likes of which had never been seen before. The ghost whale then turned sharply out to sea, and swiftly vanished into the current, taking all the strange fish and birds with it, never to be seen again. The terrified villagers returned home, realizing that the skeletal whale must have been a bakekujira – the ghost of a whale turned into a vengeful ghost.

      'Bakeneko are monster cats that have lived long enough to become yokai and gain supernatural powers in Japanese mythology. Cats, feral and domestic, are found all over Japan: in houses as pets, on farms as exterminators, and in cities and towns as strays. When cats live to an old age, they begin develop supernatural powers and transform into yokai. Bakeneko begin their supernatural life looking almost identical to an ordinary housecat. Soon they begin to walk about at on their hind legs. As they age and their powers increase, they can grow to be very large, sometimes as big as a full-grown human. Bakeneko possess great shape-shifting abilities and frequently disguise themselves as smaller cats or humans – sometimes even their own masters. While in disguise, they like to dress up as humans with a towel wrapped around their head and dance around merrily. Many learn to speak human languages. They can eat things that are much bigger than they are, and even poisonous things, without any difficulty at all. It is even possible for a bakeneko to eat its own master and then take his form, living on in his place. If they do not kill their owners, they often bring down great curses and misfortune upon them. They can summon ghostly fireballs and are known to accidentally start house fires, their tails acting like torches on any flammable materials in the house. They also have the disturbing ability to reanimate fresh corpses and use them like puppets for their own nefarious purposes. They are generally a menace to any house they live in or near. Bakeneko can come into being as a result of a number of things, but the most common reasons are by living long-life (generally over 13 years), growing to a certain size (over 3.75 kilograms), by licking up large quantities of lamp oil. A telltale sign that a cat may be close to becoming a bakeneko is believed to be an exceptionally long tail. This superstition led to the custom of bobbing a cat’s tail at an early age to prevent it from growing supernaturally long and transforming into a yokai.',

It is usually depicted with a characteristic looped tail and a single horn on the nose. It was generally believed to be a sea serpent, but are also variously believed to inhabit either the sky or the underworld.

Once, Bunjil asked him to come and live with him, but Balayang replied that Bunjil\'s country was too dry and that Bunjil ought to come and live with him instead. This upset Bunjil, who sent his two helpers, Djurt-djurt the nankeen kestrel and Thara the quail hawk, after Balayang. They set fire to the bat\'s country and Balayang and his family were scorched and turned permanently black. Because of his black coloring, Balayang was associated with Crow, and thus belonged to the moiety in opposition to Eaglehawk. Another story credits him with creating or finding Crow women (and thus marriage partners for the Eaglehawk moiety). One day Balayang was amusing himself by thumping the surface of the water, causing it to thicken into mud. Something stirred underneath the mud and, probing with a branch, he found two women. He called one Kunnawarra ("black swan") and the other Kururuk ("native companion"). He took them to Bunjil, who gave them as wives to the men he had created. Balayang was represented in the night sky by the star Antares.',

  'text': 'In Irish mythology, Balor was the tyrant leader of the Fomorians, a group of supernatural beings. He is often described as a giant with a large eye that wreaks destruction when opened. Balor is primarily known from the tale in which he is killed by his grandson Lugh. He has been interpreted as a personification of drought, blight, and the scorching sun. Balor is said to be the son of Buarainech, husband of Cethlenn, and grandson of Neit. He is a tyrant who oppresses Ireland from his fortress on Tory Island. The Cath Maige Tuired calls it a destructive and poisonous eye that when opened, permits an entire army to be overwhelmed by a few warriors. It was said that four warriors had to lift the eyelid, which became poisonous after Balor looked into a potion being concocted by his father\'s druids. Later folklore says that he has only one eye and describes it as follows: "He had a single eye in his forehead, a venomous fiery eye. There were always seven coverings over this eye. One by one Balor removed the coverings. With the first covering the bracken began to wither, with the second the grass became copper-colored, with the third the woods and timber began to heat, with the fourth smoke came from the trees, with the fifth everything grew red, with the sixth it sparked. With the seventh, they were all set on fire, and the whole countryside was ablaze!". Balor hears a prophecy that he would be killed by his grandson. To avoid his fate, he locks his only daughter, Ethniu, in a tower on Tory Island to keep her from becoming pregnant. One day, Balor steals a magical cow of abundance, the Glas Gaibhnenn, from Goibniu the smith, and takes it to his fortress on Tory Island. Cian, who was guarding the cow for Goibniu, sets out to get it back. With the help of the druidess Biróg, Cian enters the tower, finds Ethniu and has intercourse with her. Balor seizes Cian and has him put to death. When Ethniu gives birth to a son, Balor attempts to drown the child in the sea or has the child set adrift on the sea to die. However, he is saved by the sea god Manannán, who raises the child as his foster-son. He grows up to become Lugh. Lugh eventually becomes king of the Tuatha Dé Danann. He leads the Tuath Dé in the Battle of Mag Tuired (Moytura) against the Fomorians, who are led by Balor. Lugh kills Balor by casting a spear crafted by Goibniu, or sometimes a sling stone, through his eye. Balor\'s eye destroys the Fomorian army. Lugh then beheads Balor, bringing the reign of the tyrant to an end.',

They travel in the mountains that are their home by skiing with their massive feet, or using them as snowshoes. In the summer they aestivate in caves and tunnels and do not come out until the first snowfall. The word barbegazi comes from the French barbe-glacée, meaning "frozen beard". Because of their penchant for high altitudes and low temperatures, they are rarely sighted by humans, but sometimes help shepherds round up lost sheep. Their greatest known excitement is surfing on avalanches with their remarkably large feet, but they are said to give low whistling cries to warn humans of the danger above, sometimes they will give their best effort to dig humans out from the snow. A modern addition to this myth is the rumored migration of the Barbegazi to North America, predominantly to a locale of French origin in northwest Minnesota named Roseau County. Numerous sightings have been reported along the Roseau River, in the depths of the often frigid northern Minnesota winters.',

The Barmanou is the Pakistani equivalent of the Bigfoot. The term Barmanou is used in several Pakistani languages including Khowar, Shina, Hindko and Kashmiri. In addition to the name Barmanou, there are other local names as well. The proposed range of the Barmanou is in the Chitral and Karakoram ranges, between the Pamirs and the Himalaya. Thus this puts its range in region between the ranges of two more famous cryptids, the Almas of Central Asia and the Yeti of the Himalayas. The Barmanou is alleged to possess both human and apelike characteristics and is said to abduct women and attempt mating with them. It is also reported to wear animal skins upon its back and head. The Barmanou appears in the folklore of the Northern Regions of Pakistan and depending on where the stories come from it tends to be either described as an ape or a wild man. The first search in Pakistan for Bipedal Humanoid man was carried out by a Spanish zoologist Jordi Magraner from 1987 to 1990. He wrote a paper Les Hominidés reliques d\'Asie Centrale on Pakistani cryptid – the wild man. In May 1992, a search in Shishi Kuh valley, Chitral, Dr. Anne Mallasseand is reported to have said that one time during a late evening she heard unusual guttural sounds which could only be produced by a primitive voice-box. No further progress could be made. In addition to this, Dr. Anne Mallasseand was not able to record the sound.',

  'title': 'Basilisk',
  'text': 'The Basilisk appeared in various forms throughout history. It started off as a small, crowned snake being able to kill with its lethal poison and evil gaze. The poison was so lethal, it left a wide trail of venom in its wake. Despite its cruel nature, it still represents power (and sometimes that of Hell in Christian mythology), thus it became the guardian creature and the traditional symbol of the Swiss city Basel. The basilisk is believed to be the most poisonous creature ever lived, there are tales where the basilisk was killed by a spear from horse-back, but the poison flowed upward and killed both the man and the ride. Its presence is so tainting, that not only herbs die of its terrible breath, but stones shatter as well. The basilisk\'s venom is so strong, that upon drinking from a well, the water remains polluted for centuries, bringing death to anyone drinking it. The basilisk can only be a male, for it must have the most proper receptacle of venom and destructive qualities. It’s is also said to be so evil that when it cannot petrify animals, it turns to plants, withering them anywhere it goes. Medieval travellers described it as a large, fire breathing creature with a terrifying roar. It soon be came described as a rooster with a serpent\'s tail and (occasionally) dragon wings. This shows similarities with the cockatrice, but there is one difference. The basilisk is said to be hatched from the egg of a rooster (yes, rooster, not chicken) and incubated by a toad, while the birthing process of a cockatrice is vica versa, a toad\'s egg hatched by a rooster. Another description of the basilisk is of a lizard with a rooster\'s head, the tail of a serpent and eight chicken legs. Based off of this, many modern depictions of a basilisk as a large, six- or eight-legged lizard, armed with a petrifying gaze. The tales about the basilisk being petrified by its own appearance in a mirror exist, but it can be slayed by other various methods. It is also vulnerable to the cockcrow of a rooster. This belief lead to travelers carrying roosters for self protection. Although, roosters never actually had the power to kill the Basilisk. It can also be stopped by the odor of a weasel. The villagers threw it in the pit (recognized by the dying vegetation nearby) of the basilisk in hope to get rid of the beast.',
