    'Abaia',

    'A huge, magical eel in Melanesian mythology. According to Melanesian mythology the Abaia is a type of large eel which dwells at the bottom of freshwater lakes in the Fiji, Solomon and Vanuatu Islands. The Abaia is said to consider all creatures in the lake its children and protects them furiously against anyone who would harm or disturb them. It is said that those who are foolish enough to try to catch the fish from a lake containing the Abaia are immediately overwhelmed by a large wave caused by the thrashing of the Abaia\'s powerful tail. Another version of the legend states that if someone were to harm a creature living in the Abaia\'s home, the Abaia would cause a great rain storm flooding the land and drowning those who had caused the harm. One example of this ability is illustrated in the following story: One day a man discovered a lake in which were many fish, and at the bottom of the lake lived a magic eel, but the man knew it not. He caught many fish and returned the next day with the people of his village whom he had told of his discovery, and they also were very successful, while one woman even laid hold of the great eel, Abaia, who dwelt in the depths of the lake, though he escaped her. Now Abaia was angry that his fish had been caught and that he himself had been seized, so he caused a great rain to fall that night, and the waters of the lake also rose, and all the people were drowned except an old woman who had not eaten of the fish and who saved herself in a tree. Although it would seem that the magical powers of the Abaia are the byproduct of human imagination and its fear of the unknown,  it has been suggested that the Abaia legend may have stemmed from encounters with an actual undiscovered species of giant eel living at the bottom of these remote lakes.',

    'An Abath is a legendary creature resembling a unicorn, first appearing in records in the 16th century. Accounts of the Abath were brought back by 16th-century European travellers to the Malay Peninsula. Described as female, with a single horn growing from its forehead, it is speculated that these were probably the result of a half-glimpsed Javan or Sumatran rhinoceros. Like the unicorn, a powder made from this horn supposedly served both as an aphrodisiac and as an antidote to poison. However, since the unicorn was invariably represented as male, and since there was only ever one in existence at any time, the Abath seems to have developed independently from the European myths of the one-horned creature.',

    'Abatwa',
    'blank',
    'The Abatwa are extremely small men; they "go under the grass, and sleep in anthills." They travel in the mist and live in the upcountry in the rocks; and they have no village. They are wholly nomadic, and kill large animals with poisoned arrows; and when they\'ve killed an animal, they eat every piece of it leaving nothing behind. If an area has no more animals to hunt, the Abatwa gather together and ride on a horse\'s back single-file from neck to tail to go look for better hunting grounds... and if they don\'t find something, they eat the horse. The Abatwa represent a great danger to the Zulu (people who are an Nguni ethnic group in Southern Africa)because they are armed with poisoned arrows which caused uncontrollable bleeding... which is why an Umutwa (the proper name for a single Abatwa) can hunt and kill large animals, but also makes a single Abatwa arrow deadly to a full sized Zulu. So Zulu had to be careful in how they treated any Abatwa they might encounter, and there was one major point the Zuuhad to keep in mind: Abatwa hated being told or reminded they were tiny. Any indication from a Zulu that they felt an Umutwa was small would instantly result in the Zulu being shot and killed! For this reason, the Zulu have adapted the rather unusual greeting of "I saw you!" when encountering any Abatwa. If the tiny warrior then asks the Zulu where he saw them from, the Zulu needs to answer in a way that implies a great size to the minuscule threat, such as "I saw you from that mountain over there." Such a greeting only works, however, if the Umutwa is somehow seen or detected; the true dreadfulness of the Abatwa comes from the very fact that their size makes them almost invisible in most circumstances. An Umutwa could shoot and kill a Zulu who nearly stepped on him without the Zulu ever seeing the being that has killed them... an attacking animal or a murderous man could be faced and dealt with, but the possibility of being killed in a way that cannot be reacted to, that ignores your personal strengths and capabilities, is truly dreadful. This worry prevents sleep and est, for the only comfort is too avoid the territory of the Abatwa altogether.',

  'text': 'The Adlet (or Erqigdlet) are a race of creatures in the Inuit mythology of Greenland, as well as the Labrador and Hudson Bay coasts. While the word refers to inland native American tribes, it also denotes a humanoid dog-legged tribe. The lower part of the body of the canine Adlet is like that of a dog and their upper part is like a man\'s. All Adlet run quickly, and their encounters with men usually end with man as the victor. In Inuit lore, they are often portrayed as in conflict with humans, and are supposed to be taller than Inuit and white people. In some stories they are cannibals. Inuit from Labrador use the term Adlet, tribes west of the Hudson Bay use the word Erqigdlit. The monstrous race begotten by the Adlet was identified with inland native Americans by the Labrador and Hudson Bay tribes; Inuit from Greenland and Baffin Land, which had no native American neighbors, use the term to refer to the half human, half canine creatures. An etymology of the word is proposed by H. Newell Wardle: adlet might come from ad, "below," and thus denote "those below." Alternatively, he argues, it might come from the stem agdlak, "striped, streaked," thus "the striped ones," in reference to American Indians who lived to the west and painted their faces. "Erqigdlet" might be a derogatory term denoting the same people. Atlat means "others," denoting American Indians from the Inuit perspective, though Newell Wardle considers this possibility secondary and deriving from phonetic similarity.',

  'text': 'The Afanc was a monstrous creature that, like most lake monsters, was said to prey upon any foolish enough to fall into or swim in its lake. One of the earliest descriptions of it is given by the 15th century poet Lewys Glyn Cothi, who described it as living in Llyn Syfaddon or Llangorse Lake, now in Powys. One tale relates that it was rendered helpless by a maiden who let it sleep upon her lap; while it slept, the maiden\'s fellow villagers bound the creature in chains. The creature was awakened and made furious; its enraged thrashings crushed the maiden, in whose lap it still lay. It was finally dragged away to the lake Cwm Ffynnon, or killed by Peredur. In the tale, Peredur son of Efrawg, resides in a cave near the \'Palace of the Sons of the King of the Tortures\'. The Palace is so named as the Addanc slays the three sons (chieftains) of the king each day, only for them to be resurrected by the maidens of the court. It is not stated why this cycle of violence continues, but when Peredur asks to ride with the three chieftains, who seek out the Addanc daily, they state that they will not accept his company as if he was slain they would not be able to bring him back to life. Peredur continues to the cave on his own, wishing to kill the creature to increase his fame and honour. On his journey, he meets a maiden who states that the Addanc will slay Peredur through cunning, as the beast is invisible and kills his victims with poison darts. The maiden, actually the Queen of Constantinople, gives Peredur a seeing stone, which will make the creature visible. Peredur ventures into the cave and with the aid of the stone, pierces the Addanc before beheading it. When the three chieftains arrive at the cave they state that it was predicted that Peredur would kill the Addanc. Some legends ascribe the creature\'s death to King Arthur. Close to Llyn Barfog in Snowdonia is a hoof-print petrosomatoglyph etched deep into the rock "Carn March Arthur", or the "Stone of Arthur\'s Horse", which was supposedly made by King Arthur\'s mount, Llamrai, when it was hauling the Afanc from the lake.',

Little is known of this spirit, other than that it shapeshifts from an orca to a wolf when hungry. Not many myths relate to this creature but a great number of myths tell of creatures that shift their shape. It is normally portrayed as a mix of an orca and a wolf. It has been said that this a dangerous creature, but most of the Inuit did not know what was attacking them while trying to get fish out in the Arctic Sea. The only thing they could think of was the wolf tracks coming out of the water. The Akhlut is very vicious, and even attacks you if you have fallen asleep near the edge. Sometimes it goes as far as the Inuit camp to snatch them up. It has a furious appetite and would eat anything that\'s close by. There are many stories of how the Akhlut came to be but, this legend is the most popular: It’s about a man who is obsessed with the sea and wants to be with it all the time. After coming off the shore, he returns to his village, but his people don’t recognize him; because he has become too obsessed with the ocean and he gets banned from the village. While out on his own, he finds pack of wolves, and because he is so hungry, like a wolf, for revenge; he becomes one with them. One day, his affection for the ocean becomes so insane that he jumps into the ocean, to be with it. He then, transforms into an orca.

According to Shinto mythology, the creature is human-like and contains a bright red color. The 19th century account by John Batchelor confirms this. His book, The Ainu and Their Folklore, provides many details of the creature. It states that the creature was 120 meters in length. The book specifies that the red color of the Akkorokamui a striking red, seemingly “likened to the color of the reflection of the setting sun upon water”. The Akkorokamui is also characteristically described with the ability to self-amputate, like several octopus species, and regenerate limbs. This characteristic manifests in the belief in Shinto that Akkorokamui has healing powers. Consequently, it is believed among followers that giving offerings to Akkorokamui will heal ailments of the body, in particular, disfigurements and broken limbs. Nade yakushi is housed within the Takoyakushi-do, a shrine dedicated to Nade yakushi, along the street Teramachi-dori, meaning “Temple town,” in Kyoto. Once, spirits cursed Rebunge, a villager of Abuta Toyoura, to see the destruction of his town. They sent a part-spider-part-human creature, Yaoshikepu, to fulfill the curse. Yaoshikepu caused rampant destruction throughout the town, slaughtering so many that the streets were filled with crimson blood. After hearing the townsfolk tremble with fear, the sea kami, Repunkamui, transformed Yaoshikepu into an octopus, and cast her into the sea. After Yaoshikepu was cast into the sea, her size began to grow, eventually beginning to consume larger prey, such as whales and ships. One day, Akkorokamui gobbled up a boat full of fishermen. In her stomach, they called for help. Hearing the cries, Repunkamui poisoned Akkorokamui, giving her great pain. As Akkorokamui hollered in agony, the fishermen escaped. However, Akkorokamui learned to harness the venom, using it to attack her prey. In a 1800s sighting, John Batchelor stated that as the monster attacked the ship, it “emitted a dark fluid which has a very powerful and noxious odour”, confirming the myth\’s actuality.',

While typically benevolent and helpful, alan are also known to be vengeful. They care very deeply for their children. Alan appear mostly human, but they sport a pair of wings that allow them to fly. As they age their skin begins to wrinkle, and in one instance an old alan was described with skin as thick as a carabao hide. They have long fingers and toes with long, sharp nails. Their hands and feet are backwards, with their fingers fastened at the wrist and their toes fastened at the heel. When they walk, their toes spread and they bend over double. These beings are usually found living in golden or otherwise fine houses, full of riches such as pots and jars filled with beads and gold. They often live deep in the woods near springs, and they can be found hanging upside down from trees. In general, they are friendly, helpful, and celebratory. They often perform tasks for humans or provide them with useful information. When idle, they are often found dancing for long periods of time. Alan gather menstrual blood, miscarried fetuses, and reproductive waste using headaxes, often from water after a woman has gone to wash her hair. They place the blood in a dish that they have inherited from previous generations, then cover it. Soon after, a human child forms from the blood, and they then clothe the child and give them a name. Humans created by alan have supernatural abilities, and are sometimes described winning battles with formidable opponents even as children. They will also often defeat evil spirits that have been troubling towns. Folk heroes often introduce themselves as the child of an alan in order to imply that they are more powerful than an average human. Their reason for creating and adopting human children like this is usually because they have no children of their own, and so have no one to inherit their possessions. After reuniting their children with their birth family, the alan will bestow upon the family great riches. They will also give the family the golden house that they live in, which usually appears in the family\'s town the next day. The alan then flies away, and is usually not heard from again.',

  'text': 'The Almas is an ape-like cryptid reported from Central Asia. They are said to inhabit the Asian mountain regions of Pamir and Caucasus as well as the Mongolian mountain range Altai. Sightings of the Almas date back as early as the 15th century. This creature has been sighted walking upright just like a human. In fact, it looks more human than a bigfoot-type creature, even said to craft clothes and tools. It is said to resemble a living cave-man. Their bodies are covered entirely with thick brown to reddish-brown hair. The facial region remains uncovered, but patches of skin are dark. The skull structure of the almasty possesses a protruding brow ridge, slanting forehead, flat nose, and large protruding jaw. Their feet are large and their fingers are long, their appendages are completely covered with hair, except for their hands. Almas is a Mongolian word for "wild man". The plural term almasty is derived from Russian, while other variations of the name are Almasti, Almaslar, Bnahua, and Ochokochi, which translates as the name for a forest deity in the West Asian regions, such as Azerbaijan and Georgia. Current accounts of the most recent sightings of the almas locate it near the southern part of Mongolia, along the Altai Mountains and the Tien Shan pass near the northern border of China. First accounted in historical records in the 1400\'s, Almas is not used to refer to one organism, but a community of many. These individuals are described as subspecies of hominids, in which humans and primates like orangutans, gorillas, and chimpanzees belong to. Almasti resemble the appearance and body framework of Neanderthals, another species of hominid, which roamed western Asia, far north Africa, and Europe, and became extinct about 30,000 years ago. Almasti are bipedal organisms, which can walk upright on two hind legs. The common height range for almas is five feet tall, but adults can be as high as six to six and a half feet. Their bodies are covered entirely with thick brown to reddish-brown hair. The facial region remains uncovered, but patches of skin are dark. The skull structure of the almas possesses a protruding brow ridge, slanting forehead, flat nose, and large protruding jaw. Their feet are large and their fingers are long, their appendages are completely covered with hair, except for their hands. In the 1800s, a man claimed to have domesticated a female Almas named Zana. The creature, after being held within numerous enclosures for many years, was trained to carry out daily tasks such as grinding grain for flour and hauling firewood. Zana, however, never learned to speak, instead using grunts and mutterings. The Almas was very athletic, fond of swimming and apparently had a taste for wine. Zana later mated with a local man and had four children. A tooth sample of one of the children was tested, so they could be real. Accounts from Russian historian Professor Boris Porchnev in 1964 explained that the Almas appeared to have a cone-shaped skull, and the teeth structures are similar to humans, except that the canines are wider. Porchnev has even reported to have encountered the descendants of the Almas, which were grouped in families that dwelled in holes on the ground. Porchnev further describes the human-like beings as having excellent swimming and running abilities, a foul odor, and a diet that consists of small mammals, vegetables, and fruits. The almasty, as nomadic creatures, have traveled beyond the areas of Mongolia in which they were frequently sighted by farmers and villagers. Stories and reports dating from the last fifty years have located the almas community around the Caucasus mountains near Russia and the Black Sea. Artifacts and evidences of the existence of almas communities have also been found in the Pamir mountains of Central Asia. One of the most recent expeditions that aimed to locate the almas was led by Russian cryptozoologist Dr. Marie-Jeanne Kofman and Frenchman Sylvain Pallix in 1992. Similar to the findings of Porchnev, the data gathered by Kofman describes the almas as large hairy creatures, weighing as much as 500 pounds, and are nocturnal creatures that can run as fast as 40 miles per hour. However, the only solid evidences Kofman was able to collect were hair samples, footprints, and droppings. Variations of names of the almas and the regions they were sighted are: barmanu from Afghanistan and Pakistan, golub-yavan from Tajikistan, ksy-gyik from Kazakhstan, and mulen from Tungus in Siberia, among others.',

They were common characters in the cheap, pocket-sized publications sold by street vendors known as kibyōshi, or yellow covers. Kibyōshi were satirical comics, heavy on illustrations, depicting urban life with easy-to-read prose. Amefuri kozō and other priest boy yōkai became popular in these adult-oriented comic books. People enjoyed their grotesque, silly, yet somewhat cute appearance. Rain that falls while the sun is out is known in Japan as kitsune no yomeiri—fox weddings.

A funerary deity, her titles included "Devourer of the Dead", "Eater of Hearts", and "Great of Death". Ammit lived near the scales of justice in Duat, the Egyptian underworld. In the Hall of Two Truths, Anubis weighed the heart of a person against the feather of Ma\'at, the goddess of truth, which was depicted as an ostrich feather (the feather was often pictured in Ma\'at\'s headdress). If the heart was judged to be not pure, Ammit would devour it, and the person undergoing judgment was not allowed to continue their voyage towards Osiris and immortality. Once Ammit swallowed the heart, the soul was believed to become restless forever; this was called "to die a second time". Ammit was also sometimes said to stand by a lake of fire. In some traditions, the unworthy hearts were cast into the fiery lake to be destroyed. Some scholars believe Ammit and the lake represent the same concept of destruction. Ammit was not worshipped; instead, she embodied all that the Egyptians feared, threatening to bind them to eternal restlessness if they did not follow the principle of Ma\'at.',

  'text': 'Amphisbaena, a Greek word, from amphis, meaning "both ways", and bainein, meaning "to go", also called the Mother of Ants, is a mythological, ant-eating serpent with a head at each end. According to Greek mythology, the amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from the Gorgon Medusa\'s head as Perseus flew over the Libyan Desert with it in his hand. Cato\'s army then encountered it along with other serpents on the march. Amphisbaenae fed off of the corpses left behind. The amphisbaena has been referred to by the poets and the amphisbaena as a mythological and legendary creature. This early description of the amphisbaena depicts a venomous, dual-headed snakelike creature. However, Medieval and later drawings often show it with two or more scaled feet, particularly chicken feet and feathered wings. Some even depict it as a horned, dragon-like creature with a serpent-headed tail and small, round ears, while others have both "necks" of equal size so that it cannot be determined which is the rear head. Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet Nicander seems to contradict this by describing it as "always dull of eye". He also says: "From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other." Nicander\'s account seems to be referring to what is indeed called the Amphisbaenia. In ancient times, the supposedly dangerous amphisbaena had many uses in the art of folk medicine and other such remedies. It is said that expecting women wearing a live amphisbaena around their necks would have safe pregnancies, however if your goal is to cure ailments such as arthritis or the common cold wear only its skin. By eating the meat of the amphisbaena one could attract many lovers of the opposite sex, and slaying one during the full moon could give power to one who is pure of heart and mind. Lumberjacks suffering from cold weather on the job could nail its carcass or skin to a tree to keep warm, while in the process allowing the tree to fall easier.',

Tricksters are mischievous figures who often oppose the will of the gods, resulting in some kind of misfortune for humans. Like many trickster figures, the wily Anansi can change his appearance to look like a human, a rabbit, a fox, or other animals. West Africans originally considered Anansi to be the creator of the world. He often acted as a go-between for humans in their dealings with the sky god Nyame, and he supposedly persuaded Nyame to give both rain and the night to people. In most stories, however, Anansi is a crafty and cunning trickster who makes life more enjoyable for himself (or more difficult for others) by fooling humans, other animals, and even the gods themselves, often using his cleverness and knowledge of his victims\' ways of thinking to trick them and achieve his purpose. In one well-known tale, Anansi asks God for an ear of corn and promises to repay with 100 servants. He takes the corn to a village and tells the people that it is sacred. During the night, Anansi feeds the corn to chickens. The next morning, he accuses the villagers of stealing the corn, and they give him a bushel of it to make up for the lost ear. Anansi next meets a man on the road and exchanges the corn for a chicken. He visits another village and tells the people that the chicken is sacred. That night he kills the chicken, and the next morning the frightened villagers give him ten sheep to replace it. Anansi later exchanges the sheep for a corpse, which he takes to a third village and tells the people that it is the sleeping son of God. When the villagers cannot wake the corpse the next morning, Anansi says they have killed God\'s son. The terrified villagers offer him 100 of their finest young men, and Anansi takes them to God to fulfill his part of the bargain. In some parts of North America, Anansi became known as Aunt Nancy or Miss Nancy in African American folklore.',

Archeologists have identified Anubis\'s sacred animal as an Egyptian canid, the African golden wolf. The African wolf was formerly called the "African golden jackal", until a 2015 genetic analysis updated the taxonomy and the common name for the species. As a result, Anubis is often referred to as having a "jackal" head, but this "jackal" is now more properly called a "wolf". Like many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts. Depicted as a protector of graves as early as the First Dynasty (c. 3100 – c. 2890 BC), Anubis was also an embalmer. By the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650 BC) he was replaced by Osiris in his role as lord of the underworld. One of his prominent roles was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife. He attended the weighing scale during the "Weighing of the Heart", in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead. Despite being one of the most ancient and "one of the most frequently depicted and mentioned gods" in the Egyptian pantheon, Anubis played almost no role in Egyptian myths. Anubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized regeneration, life, the soil of the Nile River, and the discoloration of the corpse after embalming. Anubis is associated with his brother Wepwawet, another Egyptian god portrayed with a dog\'s head or in canine form, but with grey or white fur. Historians assume that the two figures were eventually combined. Anubis\' female counterpart is Anput. His daughter is the serpent goddess Kebechet.',

They are followed by a host of eerie birds and strange fish. They appear on rainy nights near coastal whaling villages. In the old days, when whales were still plentiful in the Sea of Japan, a whale sighting was a blessing for the residents of a poor fishing village. A village could reap huge amounts of wealth from the meat and oil in a single whale. Such a bounty did not come without a price, however, and many fishermen claim that the souls of these whales live on as bakekujira, seeking revenge against the humans who took their lives. Those who witness a bakekujira are infected with its horrible curse, which they bring back to their villages when they return home.

The ghost whale then turned sharply out to sea, and swiftly vanished into the current, taking all the strange fish and birds with it, never to be seen again. The terrified villagers returned home, realizing that the skeletal whale must have been a bakekujira – the ghost of a whale turned into a vengeful ghost.

Bakeneko possess great shape-shifting abilities and frequently disguise themselves as smaller cats or humans – sometimes even their own masters. While in disguise, they like to dress up as humans with a towel wrapped around their head and dance around merrily. Many learn to speak human languages. They can eat things that are much bigger than they are, and even poisonous things, without any difficulty at all. It is even possible for a bakeneko to eat its own master and then take his form, living on in his place. If they do not kill their owners, they often bring down great curses and misfortune upon them. They can summon ghostly fireballs and are known to accidentally start house fires, their tails acting like torches on any flammable materials in the house. They also have the disturbing ability to reanimate fresh corpses and use them like puppets for their own nefarious purposes. They are generally a menace to any house they live in or near.

A telltale sign that a cat may be close to becoming a bakeneko is believed to be an exceptionally long tail.

Once, Bunjil asked him to come and live with him, but Balayang replied that Bunjil\'s country was too dry and that Bunjil ought to come and live with him instead. This upset Bunjil, who sent his two helpers, Djurt-djurt the nankeen kestrel and Thara the quail hawk, after Balayang. They set fire to the bat\'s country and Balayang and his family were scorched and turned permanently black. Because of his black coloring, Balayang was associated with Crow, and thus belonged to the moiety in opposition to Eaglehawk. Another story credits him with creating or finding Crow women (and thus marriage partners for the Eaglehawk moiety). One day Balayang was amusing himself by thumping the surface of the water, causing it to thicken into mud. Something stirred underneath the mud and, probing with a branch, he found two women. He called one Kunnawarra ("black swan") and the other Kururuk ("native companion"). He took them to Bunjil, who gave them as wives to the men he had created. Balayang was represented in the night sky by the star Antares.',

  'text': 'In Irish mythology, Balor was the tyrant leader of the Fomorians, a group of supernatural beings. He is often described as a giant with a large eye that wreaks destruction when opened. Balor is primarily known from the tale in which he is killed by his grandson Lugh. He has been interpreted as a personification of drought, blight, and the scorching sun. Balor is said to be the son of Buarainech, husband of Cethlenn, and grandson of Neit. He is a tyrant who oppresses Ireland from his fortress on Tory Island. The Cath Maige Tuired calls it a destructive and poisonous eye that when opened, permits an entire army to be overwhelmed by a few warriors. It was said that four warriors had to lift the eyelid, which became poisonous after Balor looked into a potion being concocted by his father\'s druids. Later folklore says that he has only one eye and describes it as follows: "He had a single eye in his forehead, a venomous fiery eye. There were always seven coverings over this eye. One by one Balor removed the coverings. With the first covering the bracken began to wither, with the second the grass became copper-colored, with the third the woods and timber began to heat, with the fourth smoke came from the trees, with the fifth everything grew red, with the sixth it sparked. With the seventh, they were all set on fire, and the whole countryside was ablaze!". Balor hears a prophecy that he would be killed by his grandson. To avoid his fate, he locks his only daughter, Ethniu, in a tower on Tory Island to keep her from becoming pregnant. One day, Balor steals a magical cow of abundance, the Glas Gaibhnenn, from Goibniu the smith, and takes it to his fortress on Tory Island. Cian, who was guarding the cow for Goibniu, sets out to get it back. With the help of the druidess Biróg, Cian enters the tower, finds Ethniu and has intercourse with her. Balor seizes Cian and has him put to death. When Ethniu gives birth to a son, Balor attempts to drown the child in the sea or has the child set adrift on the sea to die. However, he is saved by the sea god Manannán, who raises the child as his foster-son. He grows up to become Lugh. Lugh eventually becomes king of the Tuatha Dé Danann. He leads the Tuath Dé in the Battle of Mag Tuired (Moytura) against the Fomorians, who are led by Balor. Lugh kills Balor by casting a spear crafted by Goibniu, or sometimes a sling stone, through his eye. Balor\'s eye destroys the Fomorian army. Lugh then beheads Balor, bringing the reign of the tyrant to an end.',

The poison was so lethal, it left a wide trail of venom in its wake. Despite its cruel nature, it still represents power (and sometimes that of Hell in Christian mythology), thus it became the guardian creature and the traditional symbol of the Swiss city Basel. The basilisk is believed to be the most poisonous creature ever lived, there are tales where the basilisk was killed by a spear from horse-back, but the poison flowed upward and killed both the man and the ride. Its presence is so tainting, that not only herbs die of its terrible breath, but stones shatter as well. The basilisk\'s venom is so strong, that upon drinking from a well, the water remains polluted for centuries, bringing death to anyone drinking it. The basilisk can only be a male, for it must have the most proper receptacle of venom and destructive qualities. It’s is also said to be so evil that when it cannot petrify animals, it turns to plants, withering them anywhere it goes. Medieval travellers described it as a large, fire breathing creature with a terrifying roar. It soon be came described as a rooster with a serpent\'s tail and (occasionally) dragon wings. This shows similarities with the cockatrice, but there is one difference. The basilisk is said to be hatched from the egg of a rooster (yes, rooster, not chicken) and incubated by a toad, while the birthing process of a cockatrice is vica versa, a toad\'s egg hatched by a rooster. Another description of the basilisk is of a lizard with a rooster\'s head, the tail of a serpent and eight chicken legs. Based off of this, many modern depictions of a basilisk as a large, six- or eight-legged lizard, armed with a petrifying gaze. The tales about the basilisk being petrified by its own appearance in a mirror exist, but it can be slayed by other various methods. It is also vulnerable to the cockcrow of a rooster. This belief lead to travelers carrying roosters for self protection. Although, roosters never actually had the power to kill the Basilisk. It can also be stopped by the odor of a weasel.

She was worshiped at least since the Second Dynasty in Ancient Egypt. The centre of her cult was in Per-Bast (Bubastis in Greek), which was named after her. Originally she was seen as the protector goddess of Lower Egypt and her image was that of a fierce lion. The name Bast means \'(female) devourer\'. In later times Bast became the goddess of protection and blessing and was the protectress of women, children and domestic cats. She was the goddess of sunrise, music, dance and pleasure as well as family, fertility and birth. When Anubis became the god of embalming, Bast, as goddess of ointment, was connected to him (sometimes viewed as his wife and sometimes as his mother) until Anubis became Nephthys\' son. This gentler characteristic, of Bast as goddess of perfumes, following Lower Egypt\'s loss in the wars between Upper and Lower Egypt, meant that in the Middle Kingdom of Egypt she became seen as a domestic cat and not as a lioness. Owing to associations with the maternal nature of cats, Bast was also regarded as a good mother and she was commonly depicted with kittens. Sometimes Egyptian women who wanted children wore an amulet showing the goddess with kittens; the number of kittens on the amulet would correspond to how many children the woman wanted to have.',

Bodmin Moor became a center of these sightings with occasional reports of mutilated slain livestock. The alleged panther-like cats of the same region came to be popularly known as the Beast of Bodmin Moor. The creature is panther-like, and black furred, and it stalks around Bodmin Moor in Cornwall, England, killing live stock. It\'s supposedly a phantom, because big cats shouldn\'t be in England\'s moors. A long held hypothesis suggests the possibility that alien big cats at large in the United Kingdom could have been imported as part of private collections or zoos, later escaped or set free. An escaped big cat would not be reported to the authorities due to the illegality of owning and importing the animals. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food conducted an official investigation in 1995. The study found that there was \'no verifiable evidence\' of exotic felines loose in Britain, and that the mauled farm animals could have been attacked by common indigenous species. The report stated that \'the investigation could not prove that a "big cat" is not present. Less than a week after the government report, a boy was walking by the River Fowey when he discovered a large cat skull. Measuring about 4 inches (10 cm) long by 7 inches (18 cm) wide, the skull was lacking its lower jaw but possessed two sharp, prominent canines that suggested that it might have been a leopard. The story hit the national press at about the same time of the official denial of alien big cat evidence on Bodmin Moor. The skull was sent to the Natural History Museum in London for verification. They determined that it was a genuine skull from a young male leopard, but also found that the cat had not died in Britain and that the skull had been imported as part of a leopard-skin rug. The back of the skull was cleanly cut off in a way that is commonly used to mount the head on a rug. There was an egg case inside the skull that had been laid by a tropical cockroach that could not possibly be found in Britain. There were also cut marks on the skull indicating the flesh had been scraped off with a knife, and the skull had begun to decompose only after a recent submersion in water.',

The attacks, which covered an area spanning 90 by 80 kilometres (56 by 50 mi), were said to have been committed by one or more beasts with formidable teeth and immense tails, according to contemporary eyewitnesses. Most descriptions from the period identify the beast as a striped hyena, wolf, dog, or wolf-dog hybrid. Victims were often killed by having their throats torn out. The Kingdom of France used a considerable amount of money and manpower to hunt the animals responsible, including the resources of several nobles, soldiers, royal huntsmen, and civilians. The number of victims differs according to the source. A 1987 study estimated there had been 610 attacks, resulting in 500 deaths and 49 injuries; 98 of the victims killed were partly eaten.

There have been numerous reports of eyewitness sightings, however the official Exmoor National Park website lists the beast under "Traditions, Folklore, and Legends", and the BBC calls it "the famous-yet-elusive beast of Exmoor."  Sightings were first reported in the 1970s, although it became notorious in 1983, when a South Molton farmer claimed to have lost over 100 sheep in the space of three months, all of them apparently killed by violent throat injuries. Descriptions of its coloration range from black to tan or dark grey. It is possibly a cougar or black leopard which was released sometime in the 1960s or 1970s after a law was passed making it illegal for them to be kept in captivity outside zoos. However, considering that cougar and leopard life spans are 12–15 years, this is unlikely. In 2006 the British Big Cats Society reported that a skull found by a Devon farmer was that of a puma, however the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that "Based on the evidence, Defra does not believe that there are big cats living in the wild in England." Eyewitness testimony has produced a number of different descriptions. Most accounts report the animal as being a large cat either resembling a puma or a panther. It is recorded as being somewhere between four and eight feet from nose to tail, standing very low to the ground, and as having the ability to leap over 6-foot-tall fences with ease. Descriptions of its coloration range from black to tan or dark grey. No such cat is native to England, and the variations in description have led some cryptozoologists to believe that there might be more than one creature. Sightings of the Beast of Exmoor were first reported in the 1970s, although the period of its notoriety began in 1983.There was even a report of the Beast seen "fishing" with its paw into the River Barle at Simonsbath, whilst some locals theorised that its lair might be in old mine workings on the Moor. The Daily Express offered a reward for the capture or slaying of the Beast. Farm animal deaths in the area have been sporadically blamed on the Beast ever since. Photographs have been produced on at least three occasions, one of which appeared in the West Somerset Free Press in 1989, taken by the Lewis Family of Blue Anchor, and all appear to show a big cat with the features of both a puma and a panther. Skeptics point out that such photographs invariably show the animal without any objects in frame that might give an indication of its size, leading to the suspicion that the photographs are of domestic cats. \'Photo 2\' is not very clear, and could well be a black dog, many say.

These creatures have been described as "panthers", "pumas" or "black cats". A fringe theory suggests that the animals may be surviving Ice Age fauna where leopards, scimitar-toothed cats, lions, and lynxs had been found in British Isles. However, the existence of a population of true big cats in Britain, especially a breeding population, is believed to be highly implausible by experts owing to lack of convincing evidence. There have been some incidents of recovered individual animals, often medium-sized species such as the Eurasian lynx, but in one 1980 case a puma was captured alive in Scotland. These are generally believed to have been escaped or released pets that had been held illegally, possibly released after the animals became too difficult to manage. Sightings at a distance may possibly be explicable as domestic cats seen near to a viewer being misinterpreted as larger animals seen farther away. In his 2013 book Feral, George Monbiot argues that humans are programmed to notice things that might be big cats because of the threat they posed in prehistoric times. Some believe that the introduction of Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 might have resulted in releases of captive animals into the wild.',

Stories of the Bugbear were used to scare children in English and Scottish tales. The name derives from the old Celtic word ‘bug’ which means an evil Goblin. During the medieval period people said that the Bugbear was a monstrous bear-monster that lurked in the woods and would capture and eat any children that wandered in there on their own. A bugbear is a medium humanoid, rising to the the same height as a human, though preferring to hunt and stalk with a stoop that make it look considerably shorter and more bestial. Short, dark fur spreads all across its powerful, hulking frame. Its large ears hang loosely from its skull, and its eyes are unnaturally large - almost alien. It is not unusual for bugbears to reach nearly 7 feet in height and always weigh more than humans, some even reaching 400 pounds. Bugbears can be found anywhere their favorite prey huddles away from the dark in fear. Bugbears originally stalked the woodlands that once covered much of England; that were dominated by the humans. Humans are bugbears\' favored prey, and bugbears used to be particularly populous in the Scottish regions of the Moor Forests before the humans started to hunt them to extinction. Now bugbears lurk hidden near wherever there are humans, from the darkened forest at the edge of a village, to the shadowy abandoned house, long forgotten with time. Though they will follow humans anywhere, they do seem to prefer temperate regions of England and Scotland (based on myth). Bugbears are particularly common in the barely settled wilderness of the Scottish Moor, where they now prey on lonely homesteads.',

The then-drunken creature was said to meow at doorsteps during the night. The cactus cat was a very hostile creature towards any animal lion their territory. Animals that crossed them often ended up with large puncture wounds, and sometimes fatal injuries. It was a desert predator. To avoid the harsh heat, they\'d carve out the inside of a cactus and sleep through the day. It eats the bugs and juice of the cactus, keeping it hydrated. They were said to be immune to scorpion venom and would hunt them at night. Cactus cats were social animals, often mating for life. They were said to live about 20 to 30 years. Before and during mating season, the male felines would break open a large Saguaro cactus and let the smell attract females to the location. Often enough, two females would be attracted to the scent, and fight. The fight usually ended in one of them getting brutally spiked or stabbed to death. The winning female would then meet with the male and drink the cactus juice. The pair would get drunk and then produce a litter of kittens within the next few weeks.

Peripillán\'s son was turned into a huge snake that would be Caicai and Antu\'s son turned into a huge snake that would be Tenten. They were to be enemies, just as Antu and Peripillán were. Caicai was sent to live in the sea to help care for it with the Ngen-ko (water spirits), and Tenten was sent to live on earth to help care for the earth with the other Ngen, and to help humanity; thus these two snakes were used as an instrument through which the will of the ancient Mapuche spirits was fulfilled. It is said that after Caicai awoke from his years-long slumber, he became enraged because of the ungratefulness that men showed for every gift given to them by the sea, and desired to punish humanity and to incorporate all terrestrial life to his dominions. Caicai used his fish-shaped tail to hit the water, causing a great flood, since Caicai ordered the waters to flood the valleys and hills, and to bring all its inhabitants to the bottom of the sea. Humans invoked the help of Tenten, who saw that both humans and animals were desperate. By order of her father, she was the one who had to provide them with wisdom and protection, so she decided to help humanity. She helped the people and the animals to escape by raising them on her back and taking them to the hills; and she transformed into birds those who were trapped by the waters, so they could escape by flying; those who were drowning into fish and marine mammals (one of them being the origin of the cahuelche (talking dolphin)), and those who had already drowned into sumpall (Mapuche mermen and mermaids). Those who were immobilized by the terror they felt, were transformed into mankial (petrified). But as the sea continued to rise, Tenten had to order the hills to increase in height to counteract the power of Caicai. Angry, Caicai began to fight against Tenten in a titanic battle that lasted a long time, until both snakes were tired. Caicai was partially defeated as he wasn\'t able to flood all the land, however, the waters did not return completely to their old level, giving Chile its current geography. According to Chiloé tradition, Caicai was satisfied with the portion of land that he had managed to flood, and delegated his functions pertaining to the sea to the great Millalobo. According to Mapuche tradition, after the cataclysm, everyone continued their quiet life; until one day it was Tenten who was angered by the attitude that men had, and made all the volcanoes erupt and the population had to move to other safer places. From that moment on, Tenten continues to manifest itself through earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, while Caicai causes tidal waves and floods when he rolls over during his sleep.',

It all started when one year, he forgot to make a sacrifice to the goddess of the hunt, Artemis, who was infuriated. To punish him and his people, Artemis sent a boar of monstrous size that caused devastation in the surrounding area. To save themselves from the beast, the people sought refuge inside the city walls, but soon hunger made its appearance. Oeneus sent a message all over Greece asking for help to kill the boar, and giving its pelt and tusk in return. A few brave men answered Oeneus\' call, including his son Meleager, as well as a fearless woman, Atalanta. In fact, it was her that caused the first blow to the beast, driving an arrow through its skin, and thus triggering its eventual death. Meleager, who had fallen in love with Atalanta, said that she should get the pelt of the boar, but his uncles, who also participated in the Hunt, protested.

The animal is said to contain riches of some sort; in some versions it is a precious stone that gives fortune and good luck to its owner. The description of the animal vary. The chaplain and explorer Martín del Barco Centenera describes it in La Argentina (1602) as "a smallish animal, with a shining mirror on its head, like a glowing coal". As explained in the Book of Imaginary Beings Barco Centenera "underwent many hardships hunting the reaches of Paraguayan rivers and jungles for the elusive creature; he never found it." In the same book, the mirror in the carbuncle\'s head is said to be akin to two lights observed by Spanish explorers in the Strait of Magellan. Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés identified these lights with the gemstones hidden in the brains of dragons. The association is likely derived from the 7th-century Etymologiae of Isidore of Seville. In Chile some say it moves like a firefly in the night. In Tarapacá, it is said to look like a bivalve with a strong white-blue shine from within the shell which can be observed from a great distance. This "bivalve" is said to have the form of a maize ear, with more than four feet. The "bivalve" Carbunclo is said to have a very good sense of hearing, which it uses to hide from people by closing its shell to be mistaken for a stone. The shining in the interior of the carbuncle is thought by some miners to come from the gold it has inside. During the great drought of 1924–25 there were reported sightings of carbunclos on moonless nights. Around 1925 a family of carbunclos was seen descending from the mountain of Tulahuén towards Río Grande (Coquimbo Region). Also in northern Chile, a man named Gaspar Huerta is said to have encountered a carbunclo while digging an acequia, but reportedly he could not see what its shape was because he killed it on the spot to recover its riches.',
